# Example data for datastorr

This is an example of the simplest test case for [`datastorr`](https://github.com/richfitz/datastorr); we have a repo that contains only a file [`datastorr.json`](datastorr.json) which indicates that the data should be read into R with `readRDS`.

The [releases](https://github.com/richfitz/data/releases) page lists a number of versions of the data.

**NOTE**: This repository is slightly weird because commits are created using git's [`--allow-empty`](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12470056) option so that meaningless changes are not created.
